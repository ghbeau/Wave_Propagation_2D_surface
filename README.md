# PHY407Final_Project
Now: Acoustic Wave Propagation on a 2D surface. 
Numerically Simulated 2D wave using a simple FDTD scheme with Neumann Boundary Conditions. 
Later tried to implement an absorbing boundary to mimic open boundaries by introducing some damping at the side.

PHY407_FinalReport.pdf was my final report for the computational physics course PHY407 at University of Toronto.
